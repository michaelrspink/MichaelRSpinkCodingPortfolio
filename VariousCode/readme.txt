This is code that I have written over the years. I will update this and date code that I put in here 

1. Modeling_Project2_MONTE_CARLO_adapted.m  
     Written for RIT MATH 622 in April 2017
     This simulates a hunting expedition between hunters and feral hogs.
     I have added the milage parameter for ease of use. See Modeling_Project2_MONTE_CARLO.m for original.
