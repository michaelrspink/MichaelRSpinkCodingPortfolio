# MichaelRSpinkPortfolio
This is a compilation of many things that I have worked on over the years that I am proud of. 
In one folder, you will find my presentations that I have given. 
In another, you will find the code for my thesis. If allowed, I will put the pdf of my thesis in this folder. The presentation for this thesis defense is in this folder, and not the presentation folder. 
In the last folder, you will find miscellaneous code for homeworks, projects, and anything else that I am particularly proud of. 
All three of these folders all contain readme.txt files describing their contents. 

If there are any questions or concerns, reach out to me via my Linkedin Page, www.linkedin.com/in/michaelrspink. Don't be afraid of being long winded, as I am also long winded. Just make sure your message is in plain text. 

Lastly, do note that this code is subject to change and I am adding to it as of 10/24/2018. 

Thanks, 
Michael R. Spink
